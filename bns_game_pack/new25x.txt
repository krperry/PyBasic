Dan's BASIC Games 2.52Thanks for downloading. Not much new...*Enhancements in 2.51*Several minor changes were made to dhl. When asked for your team name, you can now hit e-chord for a default of "human". The prompts given when asking for player names have been made shorter for easier readability on braille displays. The time necessary to set up the impossible difficulty has been somewhat decreased. The game now has some more random phrases. Taking shots that miss the net no longer count in shot totals. Finally, I fixed a spelling error when losing a game.Games.txt and answer.txt were updated with my new email address, the references to purchasing these games were removed, etc. Update*.txt were renamed to new*.txt.*Enhancements in 2.52*A nice bug that caused stock prices in stock.bas never to change has been fixed. Second, although the code was always there for the possibility for a stock to remain unchanged, it was never called. This is now fixed; so, stocks may now remain stable instead of increasing or decreasing. Finally, the game now lasts for 20 days instead of 30 (was way too long).Email me at daniel_zingaro@hotmail.com; tell me you downloaded these games, and send me your comments and questions. If I get enough mail, I'll periodically update these...
